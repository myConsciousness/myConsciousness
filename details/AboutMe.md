## **_Hello guys!ðŸ‘‹_**

I'm a `freelance developer` based in Tokyo area, Japan.

I specialize in `backend development of Java-based web applications and business improvement tools`.

My area of expertise is `Java`, but I will basically use any language if I need it. In fact, in the past I've used `Python` to create a [crawling and scraping desktop app](https://github.com/myConsciousness/metis) in the past.

> Caution:<br>
> I don't know if I can run the app now and crawl pages successfully, as it's many years old!

I also created an [Android app](https://github.com/myConsciousness/duovoc) once in the past and **_published it on the Play Store_**. Only a few people in the world used it, but it feels good to know that someone in the world is using the app I created!ðŸŒ±

**_Basically, I create everything!_** ðŸ˜„
