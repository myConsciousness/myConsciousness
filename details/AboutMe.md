## **_Hello Guys!ðŸ‘‹_**

I am a `freelance developer` based in Tokyo area, Japan.

I specialize in `backend development of Java-based web applications and business improvement tools`.

My area of expertise is `Java`, but I will basically use any language if I need it. In fact, in the past I have used `Python` to create a [crawling and scraping desktop app](https://github.com/myConsciousness/metis) in the past.

> Caution:<br>
> I do not know if I can run the app now and crawl pages successfully, as it's many years old!

I also created an [Android app](https://github.com/myConsciousness/duovoc) once in the past and **_published it on the Play Store_**. Only a few people in the world used it, but it feels good to know that someone in the world is using the app I created!ðŸŒ±

**_Basically, I create everything!_** ðŸ˜„

## Mind As a Developer

In the past, I was responsible for the `design and development` of a `payment processing system for SONY` and a `customer management system for NTT DOCOMO`.

**_These experiences form the basis of my technical capabilities._**

However, I do not rest on my laurels from those experiences, and `I am always trying to learn the basics and the latest technology!`ðŸ’ª This attitude will never change, even if I am getting older!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

## How I Work

**_I am constantly developing with the following matters in mind_**

- `Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)`
- `Clean and Readable code`
- `Meaningful naming of objects`
- `Easy to use and expandable interface`
- `Secure and fast development with few bugs`
- `Awareness of the improvement of all things`
- etc...
